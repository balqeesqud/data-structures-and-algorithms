# Implementation: Singly Linked Lists
In this challenge, I'm working on creating and implementing linked lists. I constructed a Node class
that holds value properties and a pointer to the next Node. Developed a LinkedList class with a head 
property, ensuring that an empty linked list is initialized upon instantiation. Within the linked list 
class, I created methods for inserting nodes at the head with O(1) time complexity, checking for the existence
of a value, and generating a formatted string representation of the linked list.
